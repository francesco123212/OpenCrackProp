# opencrackprop
Tired of using commercial tools with outdated GUIs, no API, CLI, little to no documentation? Welcome to opencrackprop, a fully opensource NASGRO-like crack propagation tool that provides:
1. transparent code and documentation 
2. extensive library of crack geometries on par with industry competitors including capablities to transition between cracks
3. exit criteria based on both fracture toughness and net stresses including limit loads
4. possibility to implement custom material models (Paris law fit + material model) and custom driving curves
5. powerfull API an CLI
6. natively batch ready, no necessity to edit and read overly verbose input and output files
7. natively parallelizable
8. light webapp with strong post processing capabilities by implementing matplotlib and giving the user access to any data manipulated by the solver and input data
